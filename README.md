### RetrieveReadsFromMappedSamples
###### Run Perl script in the same directory where you have the SAM files
###### Example:  $perl get.mapped.seq.pl YFP_POS_B1.sam
######  This will give you 3 files; reads that mapped to 1 isoform (AT2G42830.1.uniq.fas) and the other (AT2G42830.2.uniq.fas) and the overlap (AT2G42830.overlap.fas)
